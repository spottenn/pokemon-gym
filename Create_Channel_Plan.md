Of course. Let's redefine the post-MVP roadmap to align with this new, leaner approach. We'll build upon the simplified "tail a text file" foundation and progressively add the more ambitious features you described.

This plan is designed to be modular. You can tackle these phases in any order, and each one adds a distinct, visible improvement to the stream.

### **The Full Plan: Post-MVP Roadmap (Lean Version)**

**Core Principle:** Maintain simplicity where possible. Each new feature should be a separate, modular script or service that reads from the data generated by the core server/agent loop, rather than modifying the core loop itself.

#### **Phase 1: The "Smart Dashboard" - Automating the UI (First Priority)**

**Goal:** Replace the manual text file in OBS with a dynamic, self-updating dashboard that shows the party, badges, and other key stats. This is the biggest immediate upgrade to the stream's quality.

1.  **Create the Dashboard Script (`dashboard.py`):**
    *   This will be a new, standalone Python script.
    *   It will use the **Pygame** library (which is already a dependency for the `human_agent`) to create a window.
    *   **Logic:**
        *   The script will continuously monitor the `gameplay_data.csv` file that the server generates in its session folder (e.g., `gameplay_sessions/session_xxxxxxxx_xxxxxx/gameplay_data.csv`).
        *   It will read the **last line** of the CSV to get the most recent game state.
        *   It will parse the data from this line: `pokemons`, `badges`, `location`, `score`, etc.
        *   It will also read the `thoughts.txt` file to get the AI's latest thought.
        *   Using Pygame, it will render all this information into a clean layout within its window. You can design this to look exactly like the other streams you mentioned.

2.  **Streaming with the Dashboard:**
    *   You will run three processes: the server, the agent, and now `dashboard.py`.
    *   In OBS, you will replace your "AI Thoughts" text source with a new "Window Capture" source pointed at your `dashboard.py` Pygame window.

3.  **Implement the "Fog of War" Minimap:**
    *   This is a feature of the `dashboard.py` script.
    *   Instead of just reading the last line of the CSV, the dashboard will now read the *entire* `gameplay_data.csv` file on startup.
    *   It will build a set of all unique `(x, y)` coordinates ever visited.
    *   On its Pygame canvas, it will draw a dot or a tiny 1x1 pixel square for each visited coordinate, creating a persistent map of explored areas.

**Result of Phase 1:** Your stream now has a professional-looking, automated UI showing all relevant stats and the minimap, all without ever touching the core agent logic.

#### **Phase 2: A Smarter Agent - Getting Unstuck and Making Plans**

**Goal:** Make the agent more robust and capable of long-term planning, moving it closer to being able to beat the game efficiently. This is where we migrate to the `langgraph_agent.py`.

1.  **Migrate to `langgraph_agent.py`:**
    *   **Action:** Port the simple Grok provider and prompt logic from your MVP `demo_agent.py` into the more structured `langgraph_agent.py`.
    *   **Benefit:** You now have a proper state machine (Observe, Think, Decide) and a foundation for more complex behaviors. The improved error handling and memory structure will make the agent more stable for long-running sessions.

2.  **Implement the "Tutorial Workflow" Tool:**
    *   **Action:** In `langgraph_agent.py`, define a new function that the LLM can call as a "tool." Let's call it `get_strategy_for_task(task_description: str)`.
    *   **Logic:** When the main agent model feels it needs a plan, it can output a tool call like `get_strategy_for_task("How to get through Viridian Forest")`.
    *   Your code detects this, and instead of pressing a game button, it makes a *second, separate LLM call* (can be a different model) with a prompt like: `You are a Pokémon Red speedrunning expert. Provide a concise, step-by-step bulleted list to accomplish this goal: {task_description}.`
    *   The expert advice is then fed back into the main agent's context for its next turn.

3.  **Advanced "Unstuck" Heuristics:**
    *   Leverage the stateful nature of the `langgraph_agent`.
    *   **Logic:**
        *   Keep track of the last 20 `(location, coordinates)` pairs in the agent's state.
        *   If the agent has been at the same coordinate for 10 steps, trigger a "local unstuck" mode (e.g., press B to cancel a menu, or try a random direction).
        *   If the agent has been in the same *location* but moving around without progress for 50 steps (e.g., wandering in a cave), trigger the `get_strategy_for_task` tool with the prompt "I am stuck in {location}. What is the main objective here?"

**Result of Phase 2:** The agent is now significantly smarter. It can formulate plans and actively try to get itself out of loops, making it much more likely to make meaningful progress.

#### **Phase 3: The "Full AI Cast" - Entertainment and Immersion**

**Goal:** Bring the stream to life with an AI personality, making it a unique entertainment product.

1.  **Create the "AI Commentator" (`commentator.py`):**
    *   **Action:** Build a new, standalone script that, like the dashboard, monitors `gameplay_data.csv` and `thoughts.txt`.
    *   **Logic:** It looks for "trigger events":
        *   `score` increases (milestone achieved!).
        *   A new Pokemon appears in the `pokemons` list.
        *   A new `badge` appears.
        *   The `location` name changes.
        *   A Pokemon's HP drops below 20%.
        *   The agent's thought contains keywords like "stuck," "lost," or "finally."
    *   When a trigger is detected, the script makes an LLM call with a "personality prompt": `You are 'Professor Grok', a witty and excitable Pokémon commentator. Briefly and excitedly comment on this event: {event_description}. Keep it to one sentence.`

2.  **Integrate Cost-Effective Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
    *   **Action:** The `commentator.py` script will take the text it generates and send it to a TTS service.
    *   **Strategy:** To manage cost, only trigger TTS for the most important events: earning a badge, catching a new Pokémon, or defeating a gym leader. For all other events, the commentary can just be displayed as text on the dashboard.
    *   You can use a local open-source model like Piper for free (but lower quality) TTS, or a cloud API like ElevenLabs for high-quality audio, only paying for what you use.

3.  **Visual Representation:**
    *   In your `dashboard.py` UI, add a section for the commentator's text output.
    *   Add an animated avatar for "Professor Grok" that lights up or moves when it's "speaking" (playing a TTS clip).

**Result of Phase 3:** Your stream is no longer just "AI plays a game." It's a fully-fledged entertainment piece with a cast of AI characters, a dynamic UI, and engaging, event-driven commentary.
