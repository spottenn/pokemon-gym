# Regression Report - Pokemon Gym

Date: 2024-07-24

## Executive Summary

Several regressions have been identified in the Pokemon Gym codebase following recent major changes, particularly around the multi-agent system implementation and vision agent updates.

## Identified Regressions

### 1. LangGraph Agent Import Error
- **Status**: BROKEN
- **Issue**: Cannot run `langgraph_agent.py` directly due to relative import error
- **Error**: `ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package`
- **Location**: `agents/langgraph_agent.py:31`
- **Workaround**: Run as module: `python -m agents.langgraph_agent`
- **Impact**: Scripts or automation that call the agent directly will fail

### 2. Streaming Dashboard Dependencies Corrupted
- **Status**: FIXED (after npm reinstall)
- **Issue**: `node_modules` were corrupted/incomplete 
- **Error**: `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` when running `npm run build`
- **Solution**: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`
- **Impact**: Cannot build or run the React dashboard without reinstalling
- **Related**: `run_streaming.sh` and streaming scripts would fail

### 3. Thoughts.txt Streaming Removed  
- **Status**: BROKEN (Functionality Removed)
- **Issue**: `thoughts.txt` streaming was removed from all agents on commit 58d6a8e
- **Previous functionality**: Agents wrote real-time thoughts to `thoughts.txt` for OBS streaming
- **Current state**: Only persistent timestamped log files remain
- **Impact**: OBS streaming integration is broken, no real-time thought display
- **Evidence**: CLI argument `--thoughts-file` was removed from vision_agent.py

### 4. Ollama Connection Issues
- **Status**: PARTIALLY WORKING
- **Issue**: Demo agent fails to connect to Ollama despite WSL utilities
- **Error**: Connection timeouts when using `--provider ollama`
- **Impact**: Local testing with Ollama is broken
- **Note**: WSL utilities exist but may not be properly integrated

## Functionality That Still Works

### ✓ Core Server
- `python -m server.evaluator_server` starts successfully
- Server accepts connections and initializes environments
- API endpoints respond correctly

### ✓ Demo Agent
- Help command works
- Can connect to server 
- Initializes game environment properly

### ✓ Vision Agent  
- Help command works
- Command line parsing intact

### ✓ Human Agent
- Help command works
- pygame initialization successful

### ✓ Multi-Agent Scripts
- `scripts/launch_agents.py` help works
- `scripts/manage_agents.py` appears functional

## Missing Test Coverage

- No unit tests found in `tests/` directory
- Only ad-hoc test scripts exist (`test_dual_pyboy.py`, etc.)
- No automated regression testing suite

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Import Issues**: Update all agents to use absolute imports or ensure they're always run as modules
2. **Fix Streaming Dashboard**: Either restore the symlink or copy the actual files
3. **Fix Ollama Integration**: Debug why WSL utilities aren't being used properly in demo_agent
4. **Add Tests**: Create a proper test suite to catch these regressions automatically
5. **Update Documentation**: Ensure CLAUDE.md reflects the correct way to run agents

## Additional Findings

### Multi-Agent System
- **Status**: WORKING
- Multiple Claude Code agents are running in tmux sessions
- `scripts/launch_agents.py` and `manage_agents.py` are functional
- Test script has some parameter issues but core functionality works

### Streaming Setup
- **Status**: WORKING (after npm reinstall)
- `run_streaming.sh` successfully starts all components
- Server, vision agent, and React dashboard all launch properly

## Commands to Reproduce Issues

```bash
# Regression 1: Direct execution fails
python agents/langgraph_agent.py --help  # FAILS
python -m agents.langgraph_agent --help  # WORKS

# Regression 2: Streaming dashboard dependencies (FIXED)
cd streaming-dashboard
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install  # Fixes the issue
npm run build  # Now works

# Regression 3: Ollama connection
python -m agents.demo_agent --provider ollama --steps 1  # FAILS with connection timeout
```

## End-to-End Test Results

### Server Testing
- **Status**: WORKING
- Server starts successfully on multiple ports
- API endpoints respond (404 on root is expected)
- Sessions are created with proper directory structure
- Autosaves and state files are generated correctly

### Agent Testing
- **Demo Agent**: Cannot test fully due to API keys not configured in .env
- **Human Agent**: Initializes and connects to server successfully
- **LangGraph Agent**: Module import works as expected
- **Session Management**: Working - creates proper session directories with images, CSV logs, and state files

### Known Limitations
- API keys need to be configured in .env for actual AI gameplay testing
- Full end-to-end gameplay testing requires valid API credentials

## Summary

Core functionality is intact with the following **confirmed regressions** that broke previously working features:

1. **Direct Agent Execution** - `python agents/langgraph_agent.py` used to work per CLAUDE.md docs, now fails due to relative imports added in commit 65a6021
2. **OBS Streaming Integration** - `thoughts.txt` real-time streaming was removed in commit 58d6a8e, breaking OBS integration for live streaming
3. **Node Dependencies** - Corrupted packages broke React dashboard build (easily fixed with reinstall)
4. **Ollama Connectivity** - Local testing with Ollama fails despite WSL utilities being implemented

**Evidence of Working State:**
- Documentation explicitly shows `python agents/langgraph_agent.py --provider claude --headless` 
- Vision agent had `--thoughts-file` parameter that was removed
- Git history shows these features were intentionally removed/broken in recent commits

The system architecture remains sound, but key user workflows that previously functioned are now broken.
