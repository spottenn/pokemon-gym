Create test files to prove functionality works as claimed. Look at the recent commits since `dacb5f7` and audit every major claim made. \n\nCheck the vision agent can actually see screenshots, verify streaming mode works, test that integrations don't break existing features. Write a comprehensive audit report with evidence (file paths, line numbers, test results). Rate each claim as PASSED/FAILED/PARTIAL and provide a corrected implementation plan for anything broken.\n\nClean up your test files when done. Document your findings and progress in `PENDING_AUDIT_PROGRESS_REPORT.md` so other auditors can build on your work."

Compare the current state against commit `dacb5f7` and identify which changes should be reverted because they're broken, incomplete, or causing regressions.\n\nRun comprehensive tests on all modified components. For each changed file, determine: does it work as intended? Does it break existing functionality? Is the implementation complete? Create a detailed analysis of what's working vs what's broken.\n\nGenerate specific revert recommendations and create a commit that undoes the problematic changes while preserving the good ones. Be surgical - only revert what's actually broken or causing issues. Test thoroughly before making reversions. Log your analysis and decisions in `PENDING_AUDIT_PROGRESS_REPORT.md`."

Verify data flows correctly, APIs return expected formats, error handling works across boundaries, and the system degrades gracefully under load.\n\nCreate integration tests that prove the end-to-end workflows function.

Then systematically update every piece of agent-facing documentation to reflect what actually exists vs what was claimed.\n\nUpdate: README.md, CLAUDE.md, Create_Channel_Plan*.md files, audit reports, and any other documentation that guides Claude or other agents. Be precise about what works, what's broken, what's partially implemented, and what the real architecture looks like.\n\nEnsure documentation accurately represents the project's current streaming capabilities, vision agent status, integration points, and development workflow. Remove outdated claims and add realistic implementation timelines based on audit findings. Read `PENDING_AUDIT_PROGRESS_REPORT.md` for the latest audit findings to ensure your documentation updates reflect all discovered issues."

Create a prioritized roadmap that addresses critical failures first, then builds toward the complete streaming vision.\n\nYour plan should include: immediate fixes for broken core functionality, integration work to connect existing pieces, missing feature implementation, testing and validation phases, and realistic timelines. Consider dependencies between tasks and identify the critical path to a working streaming system.\n\nDocument your strategic analysis and completion plan in `PENDING_AUDIT_PROGRESS_REPORT.md`.
