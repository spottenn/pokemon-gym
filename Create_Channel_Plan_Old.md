## **The Full Plan: Post-MVP Roadmap**

This is where we'll implement your more advanced ideas. Review the MVP to see further related details

###**Phase 1: Stabilization & Core Enhancements (First Few Days)**

1.  **Migrate to `langgraph_agent.py`:**
    *   **Action:** Port your Grok provider logic from the `demo_agent` to the `LLMProvider` class in `langgraph_agent.py`.
    *   **Reason:** This gives you a robust state machine, better memory management (which you can still choose to ignore in the prompt), and superior error handling for a 24/7 stream.

2.  **Build the "Fog of War" Minimap:**
    *   **Concept:** Create a separate Python script (or integrate into the agent) that:
        1.  Listens to the `gameplay_data.csv` file being written by the server.
        2.  Reads the `location` and `coordinates` for each step.
        3.  Maintains a dictionary of visited coordinates.
        4.  Uses Pygame or another library to draw a simple grid representing the world map.
        5.  Fills in a pixel/tile for each visited coordinate.
        6.  You can then window-capture this Pygame window in OBS.

3.  **Automate the UI/Dashboard:**
    *   Instead of `tail`-ing a log file, have your new "UI" script (from the minimap step) also read the game state (party, badges) from `gameplay_data.csv` and display it cleanly.
    *   You can then explore your Google AI Studio idea to generate the HTML/CSS for this dashboard, which you can run locally and capture with OBS's "Browser Source."

###**Phase 2: Advanced Agent Capabilities (First Week)**

1.  **Implement the "Tutorial Workflow" Tool:**
    *   **Action:** Add a new tool to the LangGraph agent called `get_strategy_for(task)`.
    *   **Logic:** When the agent calls this tool (e.g., `get_strategy_for("beat brock")`), it triggers a *separate* LLM call to a model (could even be a cheaper one) with a prompt like: "You are a Pokemon Red expert. Provide a concise, step-by-step guide to achieve the following goal: {task}."
    *   The result is fed back into the agent's context, giving it a high-level plan.

2.  **Develop a Robust "Unstuck" Mechanism:**
    *   Expand on the `langgraph_agent`'s simple "random move" idea.
    *   **Logic:** If the agent's `location` and `coordinates` haven't changed in the last 20 steps, trigger an "unstuck" state.
    *   In this state, the system prompt changes to: "CRITICAL: You are stuck. Your goal is to get to a new location. Ignore your previous task. Make 5 random-seeming but logical moves to explore."

###**Phase 3: The Full Stream Experience (Ongoing)**

1.  **AI Commentator:**
    *   **Action:** Create a third script, `commentator.py`.
    *   **Logic:** This script reads the `gameplay_data.csv` and the agent's `grok_thoughts.log`. It watches for interesting events (new location, badge earned, Pokemon caught, HP critical).
    *   When an event occurs, it makes an LLM call with a prompt like: "You are a hype Twitch commentator. Briefly and excitedly comment on this event: {event_description}."

2.  **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
    *   **Cost-Effective Strategy:** Don't have the commentator speak constantly. Only trigger TTS for high-importance events (catching a rare Pokemon, winning a gym battle, fainting).
    *   **Integration:** Use a service like ElevenLabs or a local open-source model. The `commentator.py` script, after generating text, will pipe it to the TTS service and play the resulting audio file.

This structured plan allows you to get a product out the door *immediately* to capture the Grok 4 hype, while giving you a clear, exciting path to build the advanced, monetizable, and highly entertaining stream you envision. Good luck
